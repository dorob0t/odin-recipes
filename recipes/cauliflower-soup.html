        <p>This is my favourite soup to make. It is super creamy and a hit with my friends!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Serves 4</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large head cauliflower (about 2 pounds), cut into bite-size florets</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>Fine sea salt</li>
            <li>1 medium red onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced</li>
            <li>4 cups (32 ounces) vegetable broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, or more if needed</li>
            <li>Scant ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>For garnish: 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, chives and/or green onions</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. If desired, line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.</li>
            <li>On the baking sheet, toss the cauliflower with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil until lightly and evenly coated in oil. Arrange the cauliflower in a single layer and sprinkle lightly with salt. Bake until the cauliflower is tender and caramelized on the edges, 25 to 35 minutes, tossing halfway.</li>
            <li>Once the cauliflower is almost done, in a Dutch oven or soup pot, warm the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and ¼ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened and turning translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds, then add the broth.</li>
            <li>Reserve 4 of the prettiest roasted cauliflower florets for garnish. Then transfer the remaining cauliflower to the pot. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, to give the flavors time to meld.</li>
            <li>Once the soup is done cooking, remove the pot from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes. Then, carefully transfer the hot soup to a blender, working in batches if necessary. (Do not fill past the maximum fill line or the soup could overflow!)</li>
            <li>Add the butter and blend until smooth. Add the lemon juice and nutmeg and blend again. Add additional salt, to taste (I usually add another ¼ to ¾ teaspoon, depending on the broth). This soup tastes amazing once it’s properly salted! You can also a little more lemon juice, if it needs more zing. Blend again.</li>
            <li>Top individual bowls of soup with 1 roasted cauliflower floret and a sprinkle of chopped parsley, green onion and/or chives. This soup keeps well in the refrigerator, covered, for about four days, or for several months in the freezer.</li>
        </ol>
